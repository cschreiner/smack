CAS notes on using and developing smack

[ ] smack-verify.py can't find the smack.h file when loaded with #include
<smack.h>.  Either something is wrong with my installation, or it would be
good to add a feature to smack so that when it invokes clang, it automatically
adds the smack include dir via -I.
