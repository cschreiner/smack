CAS notes on using and developing smack

[ ] Each file using smack assertions and other features must include smack.h.
Currently the whole directory to this file is required, like this:
#include "/uusoc/scratch/euler/cas/tuut/x86_64/smack-project/smack/install/include/smack/smack.h"

[ ] What does smack-verify.py's message "Finished with 0 verified" mean?
(from "Finished with 0 verified, xx errors").  I infer it does not mean
nothing was verified at all, or does it mean no assertions were verified?
TODO: verify this with ZR.

Smack Desired Features
----------------

[ ] add feature that when smack invokes clang, it automatically adds the
appropriate include dir via an -I option so that smack.h can be included as
#include <smack.h> without additional installation-specific dirs being
specified.  It would be acceptable if this needed to be #include
<smack/smack.h> so one -I option could also cover the additional .h files in
the smack installations include tree.  Changes appear to be necessary in
bin/smackgen.py (call to subprocess.Popen()).  Note that a similar change has
already been made in rise4fun/smack_server.py (call to subprocess.call()).

[ ] updated build-linux.sh so it can handle prerequisite systems like corral or
mono being pre-installed on the system, but still need to have symbolic links
pointing to them.  Akin to what I have in TUUT.

[ ] foreach .py file in smack/bin, have a symbolic link pointing to it without
the .py suffix, to save on typing.  For example, a link called foo pointing to
foo.py.
