Christian's notes on corral:

Akash Lal on corral's multithreaded features:

> Corral follows a multi-threaded mode of concurrency with shared memory. The=
>  way to spawn a thread is:
> 
> async call foo(args);
> 
> All global variables are assumed to be shared among threads. Besides this, =
> the only primitive you get is for atomic blocks. This can be done by calls =
> to the following procedures:
> 
> procedure corral_atomic_begin();
> procedure corral_atomic_end();
> 
> Assertions are not allowed to occur in atomic blocks, and atomic blocks can=
> not nest. Look at the examples in corral\test\regression\003
